# Implementing Graph Algorithms in Unity


This project focuses on visualizing classic graph search and pathfinding algorithms in Unity. These algorithms include **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, **Dijkstra's Algorithm**, and **A\* Search**. The goal is to provide a clear visualization of how these algorithms work and how they explore a grid to find paths between two points.

The algorithms are implemented through a **grid-based system**, each tile represents a node in the graph. The grid can be interacted with and edited, there is also an option of generating a randomized maze. The algorithms will then attempt to find the shortest path from the start point to the end point, each step of the algorithm is visualized by color changes on the grid.
